# Keyboardio Model 01

## My personal layout

## Why I did this layout?

### Wanted
Super access to shortcuts to navigate in a file and on homerow on left, right, up and down (it will be on the right fn).
Super access shortcuts for most used like the on generally in File or Edit meun with on homerow (it will be on the left fn, first row for file, homerow for delete, undo, cut, copy, paste, find, go to)
Super easy access to search in windows (like switchero on windows and rofi on linux), app (like executor.dk on window and rofi on linux) and also in app tabs (it will be on palm key)
Easy access to numpad (it will be on the right num on first and homerow)
Easy access to Super + direction (it will be on the right num on third row)
Easy access to altgr for bépo (it will be on the left num) with some adaption from altgr of bépo
Super acces to shortcuts to navigate in different file through Intellij (third row on the left fn)
Alt tab, Esc must be on the left
Shift management must be as quick as possible (OneShot plugin is used)
All modifier can be easily useable (OneShot plugin is used for Alt/Ctrl)
Vi mode should be great for composed command.

### Plugin tested but not or little used
Difficult to use qukeys on homerow for modifier because the letter will be shown when the key is released not tapped and I never adapted to it, qukeys used only on palm keys.
